  "description": "Tracks item and currency changes on your account.\n- Click on its menu icon at the top left of the gw2 screen to show the tracker window.\n- This module uses DRF to track items and currencies. Instructions for setting up DRF can be found in the settings.\n- Requires at least 'Window 8' because of WebSocket technology.\n- The GW2 API is used too for various things like calculating the profit and getting item/currency icons and details. While DRF is very fast, the GW2 API may still delay the tracking by several seconds.\n- Differences from session tracker module: can track every item; does not show total counts on account; tracks much faster because of DRF.",
